# Geographical Features in Survival Analysis

This repository contains the code and data for the paper titled "Geographical Features in Survival Analysis" by Navid Seidi, Ardhendu Tripathy and Sajal Das.

## Abstract
Survival analysis is a widely used statistical method in healthcare that predicts the time it takes for an event of interest to occur. In this paper, we explore how incorporating geographical location-based public health features can improve the accuracy of survival analysis models. We demonstrate this approach on datasets of cancer patients in ten US states and show that the inclusion of these features leads to significant improvements in the concordance index. We also perform t-tests to show that these improvements are statistically significant.
